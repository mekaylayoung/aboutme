	<h3> Dis part my biographyðŸŒ¸</h3>
		<p> I'm not sure what to put here so I'm just gonna put basic information about me. My name is Mekayla Shanice Young, I'm 17 years old and my birthday is May 21st (gemini). I go to the Academy for Careers in Television and I'm a senior... but guess what. I don't even have an interest in film anymore and that's why I came to the school in the first place! I would like to major in Psychology in college and possibly become a psychiatrist.</p>
		<p> I am a middle child of two sisters and we live with our mom in New York. I do not have any pets at the moment but on October 20th I will be getting a bearded dragon. My hobbies include dancing, writing and photogrpahy. My favorite flower is Sunfowers and my favorite color is blue.</p>

	<h3> TechnologyðŸ“± </h3>
		<p> I have an iPhone X at the moment and so far it is my favorite phone model I have owned. At home I also have a macbook air and a smart TV. Truthfully I don't use either as often as I use to but with the upcoming school year I'm bound to use my laptop more. </p>

	<h2> A Fun Little Game ðŸ˜‰ </h2>
		<p> Below will be three statements that I have put together from my life. But there's a catch! Only TWO of the statements are true events and the other is completely made up. It's up to you to figure out which two are the truths and which is a lie. </p>
			<ol> 
				<li> I fell and sprained my knee when I was in 7th grade </li>
				<li> I learned how to swim when I was 6 years old. </li>
				<li> My parents almost named me Destiny instead of Mekayla. </li>
				</ol>
